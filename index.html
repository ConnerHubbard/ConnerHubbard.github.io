<p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Conner, I am 18 years old and studying computing studies at RMIT. I was born in Sydney but moved to Melbourne at a very young age. I am American on my dad&rsquo;s side and often visit Denver to see family. I studied at Geelong Grammar School for my whole life and started boarding for the last 2 years of my schooling. I am very passionate about Esports and hope to one day play in the Overwatch Contenders Australia. I have been playing overwatch since the launch in 2016 and am currently the second highest rank in the game. I have two Dachshunds named Darcy and Lady. I have also been a passionate skier ever since I was around 3 years old. I have mostly skied at Mt Hotham, where my dad owns a brewery, but I have been to steamboat in Colorado and Whistler in Canada.</p>

<p><strong>Interest in IT </strong></p>
<p>During the whole of my year 12 I had no idea what I wanted to do in uni. I was considering doing a business course or psychology, as those were my best subjects, however one day when scrolling through YouTube recommendations I found a video by a YouTuber Michael Reeves &ldquo;the robot that shines a laser in your eye&rdquo; and this immediately sparked my interest in programming and IT in general. My only experience with coding was watching YouTube tutorials and trying to learn C++. I chose to study at RMIT for numerous reasons. I had heard that it had great IT courses from my friends, so I was eager to enrol in computing studies. Another reason was that it was a very easy journey from my house and my brother had already been at RMIT for a few years so if I had any questions or was confused he could help me out.</p>

<p><strong>Personal Profile </strong></p>
<p><strong>Learning style</strong></p>
<p>From my results visual was my highest scoring learning style. Throughout my schooling life I learned the best through trying to visualize a problem or draw it out on a piece of paper. I also find that watching YouTube videos really helps for me to learn a new concept. Auditory was my second highest. This means that I can learn through just listening to the lecture but to really do well in this subject I will have to use more visual learning this could be done with my notes, lecture slides or YouTube videos. My lowest scoring is tactile this is learning through doing practical work. I&rsquo;ve never really been great at problem solving so I find learning through doing very difficult to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>MBTI </strong></p>
<p>My personality type is INFJ-T. and INFJ is often described as an advocate with an inborn sense of idealism and morality. INFJ&rsquo;s are very rare making up less than one percent of the population. This personality type may be useful while working with a team on an IT project. INFJs &ldquo;tend to see helping others as their purpose in life.&rdquo; The strengths associated with the INFJ personality type are creative, insightful, decisive, passionate and altruistic having these strengths in an IT environment would easily allow me to come up with new ways to do things and being passionate about working would help me to enjoy working. &nbsp;The weaknesses associated however are sensitive, extremely private, perfectionist and can burn out easily. Some of these weaknesses would stop me from doing well in a workspace, as I do burn-out easily that would be my main problem with trying to work is losing passion and giving up once it gets too hard. Being extremely private would also hinder my ability to make contacts with others in the environment possibly meaning that I do not enjoy working as much as if I had connections.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Big five personality test&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>The big five personality test tests how you measure up in the five personality traits. These are openness (someone&rsquo;s tendency to think in abstract and complex ways), conscientiousness (someone&rsquo;s ability to exercise self-discipline), extraversion (the inclination to seek stimulation from the outside word), agreeableness (a person&rsquo;s tendency to put others needs in front of their own) and neuroticism (a person&rsquo;s tendency to experience negative emotions). Openness was my second highest scoring with 67%. Conscientiousness was my second lowest score with 40%. Extraversion was my lowest with 27%. Third highest was agreeableness and highest was neuroticism.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Perfect Job</strong></p>
<p>Ever since I was little when I got my first Xbox and started playing halo 2 I have loved video games. Video games have been a major part in my upbringing and it is what I am passionate about. As overwatch is the game that I have sunk the most hours into and have been competitive in I one day hope of joining Blizzard and working as a developer on one of their titles. Unfortunately, I could not find a job advertisement from blizzard for developers for games. Gaming has inspired me and been very prevalent in my life that I want to give back and help make a game that people become passionate about. This is my major goal in life to create something that people really enjoy, and I have fun creating. This doesn&rsquo;t necessarily have to be developing a game it could be working on lore and storyline or creating the textures and designing characters. As I have a high knowledge of the game overwatch and play at a high level I would feel that even getting a job to balance the game would be a viable option for me. This is my dream job and I probably won&rsquo;t be able to work for blizzard someday but hopefully wherever I end up working I feel satisfied with my job and enjoy doing what I do.</p>

<p><strong>IT project</strong></p>
<p>For my IT project I have struggled a bit with finding inspiration. As Michael Reeves was the youtuber who made me want to study IT I was thinking of doing something stupid like he does on his channel, but I don&rsquo;t think my coding skills are quite up to par with his and it probably won&rsquo;t work out. I thought of doing a game. Just a simple platformer that feels satisfying to play. I would want to work on making speed and momentum the focus of my game, so the gameplay flows well. (think maybe something like Rayman legends or speedrunners maybe even like early sonic games) I have no prior experience of making games however, but I have seen how easy it can be to use game maker studios or similar engines. This game would have different characters who all feel different to play as.</p>
<p>I thought of having a big character who at first moves slow but as he gains momentum his speed increases significantly. Another character may be small and start out fast but doesn&rsquo;t gain as much momentum as he doesn&rsquo;t have much weight behind him. &nbsp;My levels would also be inspired by Rayman legends. The levels would be set in a sort of fantasy world but as the levels progressed and the difficulty increases I was thinking of changing the style to more cyber punk and futurist. I think it would take me a while before I manage to program this game. I haven&rsquo;t thought of the technical aspects of it as much as I have the actual gameplay and design but I&rsquo;m sure as I learn more this will become much easier to manage.</p>
