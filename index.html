<p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Conner, I am 18 years old and studying computing studies at RMIT. I was born in Sydney but moved to Melbourne at a very young age. I am American on my dad&rsquo;s side and often visit Denver to see family. I studied at Geelong Grammar School for my whole life and started boarding for the last 2 years of my schooling. I am very passionate about Esports and hope to one day play in the Overwatch Contenders Australia. I have been playing overwatch since the launch in 2016 and am currently the second highest rank in the game. I have two Dachshunds named Darcy and Lady. I have also been a passionate skier ever since I was around 3 years old. I have mostly skied at Mt Hotham, where my dad owns a brewery, but I have been to steamboat in Colorado and Whistler in Canada. I&rsquo;m really passionate about music, I mostly listen to alternative music and death grips is my favourite band.</p>

<p><strong>Interest in IT </strong></p>
<p>During the whole of my year 12 I had no idea what I wanted to do in uni. I was considering doing a business course or psychology, as those were my best subjects, however one day when scrolling through YouTube recommendations I found a video by a YouTuber Michael Reeves &ldquo;the robot that shines a laser in your eye&rdquo; and this immediately sparked my interest in programming and IT in general. My only experience with coding was watching YouTube tutorials and trying to learn C++. I chose to study at RMIT for numerous reasons. I had heard that it had great IT courses from my friends, so I was eager to enrol in computing studies. Another reason was that it was a very easy journey from my house and my brother had already been at RMIT for a few years so if I had any questions or was confused he could help me out.</p>

<p><strong>Personal Profile </strong></p>
<p><strong>Learning style</strong></p>
<p>From my results visual was my highest scoring learning style. Throughout my schooling life I learned the best through trying to visualize a problem or draw it out on a piece of paper. I also find that watching YouTube videos really helps for me to learn a new concept. Auditory was my second highest. This means that I can learn through just listening to the lecture but to really do well in this subject I will have to use more visual learning this could be done with my notes, lecture slides or YouTube videos. My lowest scoring is tactile this is learning through doing practical work. I&rsquo;ve never really been great at problem solving so I find learning through doing very difficult to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>MBTI </strong></p>
<p>My personality type is INFJ-T. and INFJ is often described as an advocate with an inborn sense of idealism and morality. INFJ&rsquo;s are very rare making up less than one percent of the population. This personality type may be useful while working with a team on an IT project. INFJs &ldquo;tend to see helping others as their purpose in life.&rdquo; In a work environment this could be a useful thought process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Big five personality test&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>The big five personality test tests how you measure up in the five personality traits. These are openness (someone&rsquo;s tendency to think in abstract and complex ways), conscientiousness (someone&rsquo;s ability to exercise self-discipline), extraversion (the inclination to seek stimulation from the outside word), agreeableness (a person&rsquo;s tendency to put others needs in front of their own) and neuroticism (a person&rsquo;s tendency to experience negative emotions). Openness was my second highest scoring with 67%. Conscientiousness was my second lowest score with 40%. Extraversion was my lowest with 27%. Third highest was agreeableness and highest was neuroticism.</p>
