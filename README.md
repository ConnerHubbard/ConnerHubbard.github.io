Hi, I’m Conner, I am 18 years old and studying computing studies at RMIT. I was born in Sydney but moved to Melbourne at a very young age. I am American on my dad’s side and often visit Denver to see family. I studied at Geelong Grammar School for my whole life and started boarding for the last 2 years of my schooling. I am very passionate about Esports and hope to one day play in the Overwatch Contenders Australia. I have been playing overwatch since the launch in 2016 and am currently the second highest rank in the game. I have two Dachshunds named Darcy and Lady. I have also been a passionate skier ever since I was around 3 years old. I have mostly skied at Mt Hotham, where my dad owns a brewery, but I have been to steamboat in Colorado and Whistler in Canada. 

Interest in IT

During the whole of my year 12 I had no idea what I wanted to do in uni. I was considering doing a business course or psychology, as those were my best subjects, however one day when scrolling through YouTube recommendations I found a video by a YouTuber Michael Reeves “the robot that shines a laser in your eye” and this immediately sparked my interest in programming and IT in general. My only experience with coding was watching YouTube tutorials and trying to learn C++. I chose to study at RMIT for numerous reasons. I had heard that it had great IT courses from my friends, so I was eager to enrol in computing studies. Another reason was that it was a very easy journey from my house and my brother had already been at RMIT for a few years so if I had any questions or was confused he could help me out.
